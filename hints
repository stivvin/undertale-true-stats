I found that most of the fun of this mod was planning out my route through the game, so I don't recommend you read this if that sounds fun to you.

The most important part of the game is Asgore, with his 80 defense. The maximum attack you can achieve is 87, and with how little damage that allows you to do, you probably don't want your attack to be any lower. This attack is achieved through being LV16 (30 base attack), with the Worn Dagger (+15), Temmie Armor (+10) and 8 Legendary Heroes (+32). Reaching LV16 requires 10,000 exp.


RUINS (LV 1, 0 EXP)
You have 0 attack. Even once you get the Toy Knife, killing even the weakest monsters takes forever, and Ruins monsters give minimal rewards. I'd recommend against killing any enemies in the Ruins.

The Faded Ribbon is probably not worth equipping, as even though defense is more powerful than in the vanilla game, the Bandage's effect of making fleeing always succeed will be very helpful at least for the beginning of Snowdin.

Toriel will kill you in one hit, but apart from her attack damage and immortality, the patch does not change anything about her fight. I won't spoil how, but this is VERY abusable.

No you cannot do Genocide. You cannot kill Toriel. Her defense will always be 80. You cannot kill the former Queen of All Monsters in a single hit with a stick/plastic knife just because you killed 20 slimes.


SNOWDIN (LV 8, ~525 EXP)
If you followed my advice for the Ruins, you'll enter Snowdin Forest at Level 1. Equipping the Tough Glove will give you 5 attack, seemingly not enough to damage any of this area's monsters. Don't worry, you can just...

Encounter Ice Cap, then use the Ignore ACT twice, followed by Steal. Voila, 25 free EXP.

After icing a few monsters, you'll reach a decent enough level to begin your grindfest, but don't get too eager yet. After killing 16 or more Snowdin enemies (NOT including Doggo, Dogamy, Dogaressa, and Greater Dog), you'll stop encountering monsters in the area. Keep track of your kills, as depleting this counter in Snowdin specifically will prevent the Nice Cream vendor from appearing in Waterfall, preventing you from obtaining Punch Cards.

Do kill Doggo, Dogamy, Dogaressa and Greater Dog, as they give relatively decent EXP without contributing to the area kill counter.

Don't bother trying to kill Glyde. His stats are too HIGH.

Do not kill Papyrus. If you manage to reach him at LV9 you could theoretically damage him, but spending hundreds of turns attacking a defenseless enemy for 200 EXP is not worth the effort.

Supposedly dating Papyrus increments the Waterfall kill counter for some reason? So don't do that.


WATERFALL (LV 10, ~1450 EXP before Undyne) (LV 11, ~1950 after) (ABSOLUTE MINIMUM 1200 EXP before Undyne)
Aaron, Woshua and Shyren give 52 EXP each. You have some wiggle room on EXP routing, but these are the best monsters to kill.

Though you can get away with killing Temmies and Moldbyggs, DO NOT KILL MOLDSMALS. They give 3 EXP.

Getting 1-shot by the spears in the Undyne chase sections? That's because they do 50 damage, ignoring defense. Easy solution: don't get hit. These sections aren't particularly hard once you get the hang of them.

The fastest way to grind money for Temmie Armor is by filling your inventory and box with Cloudy Glasses (bought for 30 gold from Gerson), then selling them in the Tem Shop for 50 gold each. This is also a good opportunity to grind encounters.

Hold onto the Butterscotch Pie (for Undyne) and the Stick (for sparing Madjicks). Or not, your choice.

If you stop getting into any encounters while making the trip between the shops, make sure to trigger an encounter before going through to the next room, as room transitions reset your step counter. I think. Maybe.

Kill Undyne. She's tough, but you can easily get through 20 defense by this point in the game, and you really need her 500 EXP.

A good strategy for the Undyne fight is to equip the Tough Glove (buy another one in Snowdin if you sold it) and use Punch Cards to boost your attack. It's up to you to determine the best balance between Punch Cards and healing items, but I had success with 6 Punch Cards, a Snowman Piece and the pie.


HOTLAND/CORE (LV 16, 10000 EXP)
DO NOT kill any random encounters or the Royal Guards in Hotland. They count towards the same kill counter as the CORE, which has far higher EXP encounters.

Yes, the royal guards and Muffet count towards the Hotland kill counter

Muffet gives 300 EXP, more than any encounters in the CORE. However, if it is very difficult to kill her before she stops attacking, and she will not continue to attack you if you attack her after she spares you (as she will always die in one hit at this point in the vanilla game). I found killing her when she didn't fight back cheap and chose to spare her. You can get away with sparing her as long as you have at least 1820 EXP.

Don't forget to buy the Empty Gun! Also, feel free to spend any spare gold on Legendary Heroes to speed up early CORE grinding, as you'll get enough gold for the last 2 bosses during your grind.

Monsters will only stop appearing once you reach 40 area kills, but you can't just kill any 40 monsters and expect to reach LV 16. The highest EXP random encounter monster is Knight Knight, giving 180 EXP.

Formula for optimal CORE grinding:
When x = EXP entering core:
If Muffet was spared,
y = (x - 1820) / 30
Kill y Madjicks and (39 - y) Knight Knights
If Muffet was not spared,
y = (x - 2000) / 30
Kill y Madjicks and (38 - y) Knight Knights
This should get you to 8840 EXP, after which you can kill all monsters in the "What a nightmare!" encounter (always the third encounter on the Warrior's Path if you don't want to get it randomly) to reach 9200 EXP

Buy 8 Legendary Heroes for Mettaton, and have 8 more in a box for Asgore. Killing Mettaton should level you up to LV 16, after which there's only one more obstacle in your way...
